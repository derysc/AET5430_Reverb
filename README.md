# AET5430_Reverb
The goal of this project was to capture different impulse responses around campus and use 
them to create a reverb using convolution. The hope is to have a drop down menu with 
different places that can be used for the reverb. Another knob I would like to have is 
a dry/wet knob and also a output gain knob. Talking to what I need to learn in C++ would 
be using the JUCE convolution DSP and also just playing with the JUCE platform and 
getting it linked to reaper so that I can get a way to hear it out. Another topic is 
getting the actual impulse responses and putting them into the program.
